Performance issue: themeConfig is defined inside the component body and is recreated on every render. This breaks referential equality and can cause unnecessary re-renders if you memoize this component or pass themeConfig to children. Fix: Move themeConfig outside the component function scope as a constant, or wrap it in useMemo (though moving it outside is cleaner and preferred).
